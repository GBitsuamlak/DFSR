# DFSR
Divergence-free Spectral Representation (DFSR) method is an inflow/inlet turbulence generation method developed for large-eddy simulation of the atmospheric boundary layer(ABL) flows. The technique uses the spectral representation method to generate ABL-like turbulence with prescribed two-point flow statistics. The code is developed as a utility application using OpenFOAM as a framwork. DFSR  offers the following key features:

- Capable of running on **unstructured** meshes
- Uses **LAPACK** subroutine for efficient matrix factorization 
- Employes the **FFT** technique for faster time-series computation 
- Parallel implementation using **OpenMPI**    

In this version of the code, the divergence-free condition is imposed on the generated turbulence by adding a gradient of a velocity potential, following the procedure developed by *Shirani et al.(1981)*. The final velocity field is written for each time step in the corresponding case directory. Mathematical details of the implemented procedure can be found in [Melaku and Bitsuamlak(2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167610521000660).

## Installing DFSR
### Requirements
Before compiling the source code, you need to have the following packages already installed. 
- **OpenFOAM**, preferably v8  
- Intel's oneAPI MKL package or **LAPACK** library    
- Fastest Fourier Transform in the West(**FFTW**) package

### Build from source  

Follow the following procedure to compile the source code. 

- Clone the code to your computer:

   `$ git clone https://github.com/abiyfantaye/DFSR.git DFSR` 

- Copy the `DFSR/src/DFSRTurb` directory to `$FOAM_UTILITIES/preProcessing/`:

    `$ cp -r DFSR/src/DFSRTurb $FOAM_UTILITIES/preProcessing/`

- Compile the code in `$FOAM_UTILITIES/preProcessing/DFSRTurb` directory:

    `$ cd $FOAM_UTILITIES/preProcessing/DFSRTurb`\
    `$ ./Allwclean`\
    `$ ./Allwmake`

The turbulence generator is now fully embedded in OpenFOAM and can be launched as `DFSRTurb` in serial or parallel.  

## Simulation Example

### Input parameters 

The directory `example/openTerrain` contains an empty domain LES case configured for open terrain conditions. The basic parameters for the DFSR method are defined in `constant/DFSRTurbDict`. The method reads the ABL profile from `constant/boundaryData/windProfile/profile` file. This file specifies the variation of the mean velocity, turbulence intensities, and length scales over the height in the following tabular format: 

| z[m]  | Uav[m/s] |  Iu   |   Iv   |   Iw   | Lu [m] | Lv[m]  | Lw[m]  |
| ----- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 0.02  | 14.56    | 0.160 | 0.120  | 0.120  | 0.750  | 0.500  | 0.300  |
| ..... | .......  | ..... | .....  | .....  | .....  | .....  | .....  |
| ..... | .......  | ..... | .....  | .....  | .....  | .....  | .....  |

The parameters that need to specified in `constant/DFSRTurbDict` dictionary are: 

| Parameter | Description | Optional | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `patchName` | Name of the patch to apply the inflow | no | -- |
| `startTime` | Starting time of the generated turbulence | yes | 0.0|
| `endTime` | Ending time of the generated turbulence  | no | --|
| `timeStep` | Time step of the inflow, can be different from the solver time step. It should be `1/(2*fMax)` to take advantage of the FFT algorithm. | no | --|
| `fMax` | The cut off frequency | no | --|
| `nFreq` | The number of frequency steps/segments | no | 1024 |
| `nInterp` | Number of spectral interpolation frequencies | no | 50 |
| `seed` | Seed of the random number generator used to sample random phase angles. | yes | -- |
| `C` | Coherency decay coefficients.  | no | --|
| `cohUav` | Mean velocity used to define the coherency function | yes | --|
| `scaleI` | A factor to scale turbulence intensity profiles in each direction to account for the decay of turbulence downstream in the CFD simulation. | yes |(1 1 1)|
| `scaleL` | A factor to scale integral length scale profiles in each direction. | yes | (1 1 1) |
| `correctDivergence` | Apply div-free corrections or not | yes | on |
| `writeSamples` | Write data for selected sampling points or not | yes | off |
| `writeInflow` | Write the final inflow data or not| yes | on |

### Output 
Finally, if the controle `writeInflow` is turned on, the whole inflow data is saved in `constant/boundaryData/<patchName>/` directory. This inflow data is later read by the solver with `timeVaryingMappedFixedValue` velocity boundary condition at the inlet. Please check the OpenFOAM test case in `example/openTerrain` directory for the details. 

If `writeSamples` is turned on, the code reads sampling points from `constant/boundaryData/windProfile/sampledData/samplingPoints`. Then, the time-series of the generated velocity components for each point in `samplingPoints` are written into `Ux`,`Uy`, and `Uz` files in the same directory. In addition, the velocity field over the inflow patch is written to VTK slices for selected time instances in the same directory. 


### Excuting the test case 

Follow the following procedure to run the test case in `example/openTerrain` directory: 

- Generate block mesh:

   `$ blockMesh`

- Decompose the case:

   `$ decomposePar` 

- Run the DFSR inflow generator in parallel:

   `$ mpirun -np 4 DFSRTurb -parallel` 
   
- Check the generated samples on paraview:

   `$ paraview constant/boundaryData/windProfile/sampledData/vtkSlices/Ut_*` 

- Finally run the LES case:

   `$ mpirun -np 4 pisoFoam -parallel`
